Challenge 1,"In Model 1, with no transformation selected for both X variables, and sqrty selected for Y what happens to the Normal Q-Q plot as you increase sample size?",It becomes more linear on the dotted line suggesting the normal errors assumption is apparent.,
Challenge 2,"In Model 1,  with none selected for both X variables, and sqrty selected for Y what happens as you increase sample size to the Residuals vs Fitted plot?","The residuals become more and more random, suggesting the equal residuals assumption is apparent and that the model is now possibly linear.",
Challenge 3,"In Model 1,  with none selected for both X variables, and sqrty selected for Y what happens as you increase sample size to the Sacle-Location plot?","The patterns tend to disappear, suggesting the equal resiudlas assumption is apparent.",
Challenge 4,"In Model 1,  with none selected for both X variables, sqrty selected for Y, and a sample size of a 100, are there any possible leverage points?",Most likely not,
Challenge 5,"In Model 1, once selected no transformation for both X variables, and sqrt Y, what do you think the model is?",Y^2 ~ x1+x2,
Challenge 6,"In Model 1,  with none selected for all variables how does changing the variances to 10 effect the Residuals vs Fitted plot?","May see a slight decreasing trend in the residuals, but the overall difference of residuals becomes larger.",
Challenge 7,"In Model 2,  with sqrt X and sqrt X2, what Y transformation makes the best model?",No transformation on Y,
Challenge 8,"In Model 2,  with sqrt X, sqrt X2, and no transformation on Y, what do the diagnostic plots suggest the model is?",Y~( X1)^2+(X2)^2,
Challenge 9,"In Model 2, with no transformations selected, and a sample size of 10, are there any possible leverage points?",Most likely will be ,
Challenge 10,"In Model 2,  with no transformations selected, and a sample size of 10, you will see a .5 line on the Residuals vs Leverage plot, what does it mean if a point is outside this line?",Possible leverage point,
Challenge 11,"In Model 2,  with no transformations selected, and a sample size of 10, you will see a 1 line on the Residuals vs Leverage plot, what does it mean if a point is outside this line?",Most likely a leverage point,
Challenge 12,"In Model 2, , as you lower the sample size what do you begin to see iin the Scale-Location plot?",Should see some type of pattern form in the red line.,
Challenge 13,"In Model 3,  with no transformations selected and a sample size of 100, are there tails present in the Normal Q-Q plots?",Large tail in the end,
Challenge 14,"In Model 3,  with sqrt for all transformations and a sample size of 100, are there any patterns in the residuals?",There should not be.,
Challenge 15,"In Model 3,  what do you believe the model is?",(Y)^2 ~ (X1)^2 + (X2)^2,
Challenge 16,"In Model 3,   does increasing the sample size tend to eliminate patterns in the residuals?",Increasing the sample size should eliminate patterns in the residuals.,
Challenge 17,"In any model, do more of the assumptions seem satisfied with a larger or small sample size?",Large sample size,
Challenge 18,"In any model, does increasing the variance tend to leave more patterns in the residuals?","Yes, increase in variance may lead to unequal variances",
Challenge 19,"In any model, are tails usually present in the Normal Q-Q plot, when sample size is 20.",With this little of a sample size tails will likely be present.,
Challenge 20,"In Model 1, with none selected for both X variables, and sqrty selected for Y what happens to the Normal Q-Q plot when sample size is 15 and you hit Get your plot button repeatedly?",It should produce a different Normal Q-Q plot each time,
